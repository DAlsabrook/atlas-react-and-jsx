            <p>I'm a full-stack developer currently in T5 at Atlas School, where I enjoy building web applications and exploring cutting-edge technologies. My favorite framework is Next.js because of its seamless full-stack capabilities. While I'm open to contributing at any level of a development team, my ultimate goal is to transition into a data engineering role after graduation.
                Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time on my 12-acre property, working on woodworking projects, and relaxing around campfires whenever the weather allows.</p>
